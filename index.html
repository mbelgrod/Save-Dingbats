        <div class="description">
            SAVE! is a dingbat typeface that replaces and obscures sales and savings copy with the shapes and symbols that traditionally ornament them. Many of the glyphs feature alternative, more honest copy such as “Spend it all!” and “Given in!”

        <div class="description">
            The typeface is inspired by the shared visual and verbal vernacular of marketing collateral that advertises “savings.” This term is just one example of marketing language that obfuscates capitalist intentions.

        <div class="description">
            To save is actually to spend. These “savings” are meant to incentivize consumers to either physically or digitally go to a retailer and spend money—often more than planned. Moreover, sometimes these “savings” are fabricated. In his research, the Harvard professor David Ngwe reported that some retailers use “fictitious pricing,” a practice where retailers list an original price on a product that does not truthfully reflect prior selling prices, to boost sales. “When a retailer like Kohl’s gets sued over this year after year, it tells you this is not only common, but it’s persistent.”
